<h3>WORKING AND PROCESSES</h3>
<br/>
<br/>Air-cooled chillers represent the cornerstone of temperature management in contemporary
<br/>industrial contexts. Operating on established refrigeration principles, they efficiently extract
<br/>heat from essential spaces and technological systems.
<br/>Here’s a detailed overview:
<br/><b>Heat Absorption: </b>The process initiates within the evaporator, where a specialized
<br/>refrigerant adeptly absorbs heat from the targeted air or water. This refrigerant,
<br/>often a low-boiling compound like R-134a or R-410A, transitions from liquid to gas as
<br/>it absorbs heat.
<br/><b>Compression Stage: </b>The compressed stage unfolds within the compressor, where
<br/>the refrigerant undergoes pressurization, significantly elevating both its pressure and
<br/>temperature.
<br/>
<br/><b>Heat Exchange Mechanism:</b> The condenser serves as the site for heat exchange
<br/>between the high-pressure gas and ambient air. Heat is released from the
<br/>refrigerant, transferring to the air and prompting condensation, returning the
<br/>refrigerant to its liquid form.
<br/><b>Cycle Renewal:</b> Via an expansion valve, the liquid refrigerant readies itself for a
<br/>return to the evaporator, poised to recommence the cycle and continue its heat
<br/>absorption.
<br/>Throughout this operational cycle, a fan diligently facilitates the airflow over the condenser
<br/>coils, ensuring effective heat exchange with the surrounding air.
<br/>Air-cooled chillers streamline the cooling process for technology-centric spaces, eliminating
<br/>the necessity for separate cooling towers or intricate water sources for heat exchange.
<br/>However, their operational efficiency may fluctuate in diverse conditions due to their
